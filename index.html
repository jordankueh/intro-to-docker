# Outcomes

By the end of today, we hope we've helped you understand:

.moar-space[
- Why we use Docker;
- Containers, images, Dockerfiles, tags, and registries;
- Configuring, running, listing, inspecting, and viewing logs of
Docker containers;
- Networking containers together;
- Sharing data using volumes;
- Why we provide config through environment variables;
- Building, pushing, and pulling Docker images;
- Addressing common security risks when working with Docker;
- Using Docker Compose to simplify working with multiple Docker containers;

name: prep
# Preparation

You will need **a good connection to the Internet** during this setup, and
through parts of the course, as we'll be installing software, and downloading
Docker "images" (more on that later).

It's useful to have a **local copy** of these training materials:

  `git clone https://github.com/realestate-com-au/intro-to-docker.git`

---
# Installing Docker

We'll definitely need **Docker**, and **Docker Compose**. Select the most
appropriate method for your system.

<hr>

**MacOS**: [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)

**Windows**: [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)

**Linux**:
- [CentOS YUM Repository](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/)
- [Debian APT Repository](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/)
- [Fedora DNF Repository](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/)
- [Ubuntu APT Repository](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

... Alternatively, for Linux:

```
# The questionable curl-pipe-to-sh method:
$ `curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh`
```

---
# Check your setup

Let's check that everything is working:

```
$ `./setup.sh`
YAY: /var/run/docker.sock exists
YAY: I can talk to docker
Docker is at localhost

YAY: docker version 18.09.2 >= 1.13.0
YAY: docker-compose version 1.23.2 >= 1.13.0

Pulling some images to get you started ...
```

Not working? Ask for help!

Don't worry _too_ much if you get complaints about versions of `docker`
and `docker-compose`

Docker only runs on Linux.

On OS X and Windows, it runs inside a VM.

# Try it: Which Kernel?

Run `uname -a` on both `ubuntu` and `centos`:

```
$ `docker run ubuntu uname -a`
$ `docker run centos uname -a`

With virtualisation, you have the added weight of a guest kernel.

With Docker, processes communicate directly with the host kernel.

# Try it: overhead, much?

Use "time" to measure the overhead of running a command in a container.

# The clever bits

Linux "cgroups" + "image" management =
![Docker](media/docker/small_v-trans.png)

---
# Linux "control groups"

</br>

Isolates processes by limiting access to:
  - Hardware resources;
  - Other processes;

--

Not the first of its kind:
  - Linux Containers, aka LXC (Google)
  - Used extensively by PaaS such as Heroku
  - Similar to Solaris Zones, BSD Jails

`cgroups` limits access to system resources,  
as opposed to `chroot`, which limits access to file system resources.

But the concepts are the same - We limit access to certain resources for our
process.

---
# Union file systems

--

Images are like onions.<br>
--
They <del>make us cry</del> have layers.

.lhs[

Images are made of these "layers", and some layers may be 'shared' across
multiple images.

The container's root file system is also another layer that can be written to.

There are many ways to 'store' these layers, such as:
  - aufs
  - devicemapper

# Try it: Container Filesystem Isolation

Attempt to break your Ubuntu image:

```
$ `docker run -i -t ubuntu bash`
root@3256d8252fe6:/# `ls /usr/bin`
root@3256d8252fe6:/# `rm -fr /usr/bin`
root@3256d8252fe6:/# `ls /usr/bin`
^D (CTRL-D)
```

Now, start another container:

```
$ `docker run -i -t ubuntu bash`
root@3ed46bfba026:/# `ls /usr/bin`
```

# Try it: View The Layers

Use `docker history` to view image layers

# Learn just enough in 5 Lessons

By the end of the exercises, you should know more about
  - Running containers
  - exposing container ports
  - getting container logs 
  - passing app environment variables into a running container
  - docker networking
  - attaching volumes to containers-vs-vms

###### (... or not. If you just want to see the solutions, go to the next slides... but it won't be as fun) 
  
---
# Try it: a long-running container

Run a container as a daemon (in the background):

```
$ `docker run -d realestate/ciao`
```

List the running containers:

```
$ `docker ps`
```

List ALL the containers:

```
$ `docker ps -a`
```

???

`-d` starts a long-running process.

Containers have an exit-status, and can be restarted with `docker start`.

---
# Try it: container cleanup

Remove a container:

```
$ `docker rm <ID>`
```

Remove a RUNNING container:

```
$ `docker rm -f <ID>`
```

Cleanup dead containers:

```
$ `docker container prune`
```

---
# Try it: name your containers

Start a container with a `--name`:

```
$ `docker run -d --name app realestate/ciao`
```

Now you can use the NAME rather than an ID:

```
$ `docker rm -f app`
```

---
name: ports
# Try it: map a port to a host port

```
$ `docker run -d --name app -p 5678:80 realestate/ciao`
```

.center[
<img src="diagrams/ciao-explicit-port.png" width=40% />
]

```
$ `curl localhost:5678`
```

---
# Remember to clean up

If/when you see:

```
docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The name "/app" is
already in use by container 5678abcd...
```

you need to remove the named container:

```
$ `docker rm -f app`
```

---
# Try it: use a random host port

If you don't specify a host port, Docker will choose one:

```
$ `docker run -d --name app -p 80 realestate/ciao`
```

.center[
<img src="diagrams/ciao-random-port.png" width=40% />
]

Use `docker port` to discover which one it chose:

```
$ `docker port app 80`
```

Hit it:

```
$ `curl $(docker port app 80)`
```

---
# Try it: logs

You can get the output using `docker logs`:

```
$ `docker logs app`
```

Again, with timestamps:

```
$ `docker logs --timestamps app`
```

or even follow along in real time:

```
$ `docker logs --follow --timestamps app`
```

---
name: environment
# Try it: set environment variables

Assuming your application looks for environment variables, e.g.

```javascript
var MESSAGE = (process.env.MESSAGE || "Ciao mondo.");
```

You can set them to provide configuration:

```
$ `docker run -d --name app -p 5678:80 \`
  `-e MESSAGE='Hey, guys!' \`
  `realestate/ciao`
```

Test the result:

```
$ `curl localhost:5678`
```

# Networks

# Consider: a reverse-proxy image

`nginx`, configured to:

* listen on port `80`
* forward requests to a host called "`app`"

  server ${BACKEND:-"app"} fail_timeout=0;
}

server {
  listen ${PORT:-80};
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://backend;
  }
}
```

I've published it as `realestate/ciao-proxy`.

---
# Try it: inter-container networking

Create a "network":

```
$ `docker network create shared`
$ `docker network ls`
```

Attach some containers:

```
$ `docker rm -f app proxy`
$ `docker run -d --net=shared --name app \`
  `realestate/ciao`
$ `docker run -d --net=shared --name proxy \`
  `-p 5678:80 \`
  `realestate/ciao-proxy`
```

```
$ `curl -si localhost:5678`
```

---
# Try it: explore the network

```
$ `docker network inspect shared`
```

```

---
name: volumes

# Volumes

---
# Try it: volume from host

Mount your home directory from the "host":

```
$ `docker run -it --rm -v $HOME:/myhome ubuntu bash`
root@c10a43c38793:/# `mount | grep home`
root@c10a43c38793:/# `cd /myhome; ls`
root@c10a43c38793:/# `echo HELLO FROM DOCKER > written-from-docker`
root@c10a43c38793:/# `exit`
$ `ls $HOME`
```

---
# Try it: named cache volume

```
$ `docker run -it --rm -v my-cache:/cache ubuntu bash`
root@c10a43c38793:/# `echo TESTING > /cache/test`
^D
```

Observe, volume created:

```
$ `docker volume ls`
```

Use it again:

```
$ `docker run -it --rm -v my-cache:/cache ubuntu bash`
root@f5be5dec8a5a:/# `ls /cache`
```

Clean up:

```
$ `docker volume rm my-cache`
```

---
# Try it: anonymous volume for extra writable space

```
$ `docker run -it --rm --read-only -v /scratch ubuntu`
root@c10a43c38793:/# `echo TESTING > /tmp/test`
root@c10a43c38793:/# `echo TESTING > /scratch/test`
```

.center[
<img src="diagrams/cow-vs-data-volume.png" width=60% />
]

Tip: read-only root volume is great for security!

---
# Try it: share a volume with another container

Create a container, with a volume:

```
$ `docker run -it --rm --name provider -v data:/published ubuntu`
root@118f38503653:/# `echo ohai > /published/stuff`
```

.center[
<img src="diagrams/shared-volume.png" width=80% />
]

Use the volume from a different container:

```
$ `docker run -it --rm --name consumer -v data:/provided:ro ubuntu`
root@d88a7a468b01:/# `cat /provided/stuff`
```

View images in the `ubuntu` repository:

```
$ `docker images ubuntu`
```

---
name: image-tags
# Try it: use an image tag

Image repositories can contain multiple images, identified by tag:

.center[
`<REPOSITORY>[:<TAG>]`
]

Run different versions of Ruby:

```
$ `docker run ruby:2.3 ruby --version`
$ `docker run ruby:2.4 ruby --version`
```

--

By convention, there's usually a `latest` tag:

```
$ `docker run ruby:latest ruby --version`
```

which is the default:

```
$ `docker run ruby ruby --version`
```

---
name: image-digest
# Try it: stable image references

Image can also be addressed with immutable digests:

.center[
`<REPOSITORY>[@<DIGEST>]`
]

```
$ `docker pull ruby:2.4 | grep Digest`
```

Use the digest:

```
$ `docker run ruby@sha256:ec92755b46504ec2d27d8a2887d080ca9ef799dfe7c010b7019b2165f875c738 \`
  `ruby --version`
```

Or, a different (older) one:

```
$ `docker run ruby@sha256:450ce48d8021d33c306168654256b9c960711e6c02991f270d55488caf860410 \`
  `ruby --version`
```

---
name: image-namespaces
# Try it: non-standard namespace

Repositories can have an optional namespace:

.center[
`[<NAMESPACE>/]<REPOSITORY>`
]

Use a community image:

```
$ `docker run -it supertest2014/nyan`
```

---
name: image-references
# Summary: image references

Image-name pattern:

.center[
`[<REGISTRY>/][<NAMESPACE>/]<REPOSITORY>[:<TAG>][@<DIGEST>]`
]

* `<REGISTRY>` defaults to `docker.io` (aka Docker Hub)
* `<NAMESPACE>` defaults to `library`
* `<TAG>` defaults to `latest`
* `<DIGEST>` is a digest of image contents

So this:

```
hello-world
```

Is short for:

```
docker.io/library/hello-world:latest@sha256:1f19634d26995c320618d94e6f29c09c6589d5df3c063287a00e6de8458f8242

# Try it: leverage the "build cache"

Use the recipe provided:

```
FROM node:6.2.2

COPY package.json /app/
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install
COPY index.js /app/

ENV PORT 80
CMD ["node", "/app/index.js"]
```

to build an image:

```
$ `docker build -t ciao exercises/ciao`
```

---
# Try it: invalidate the "build cache"

Build it again:

```
$ `docker build -t ciao exercises/ciao`
```

Faster, eh? Observe: "Using cache".

--

Now try this:

* Edit `exercises/ciao/index.js`, changing the default MESSAGE from "Ciao mondo" to something else, then build again. What happens at "Step 5"?

--

* Make a change to `exercises/ciao/package.json`, and build again. What happens at "Step 4"?

# Tip: set config defaults with "ENV"

The `env` directive sets a default value for an environment variable.

```

---
# Tip: implicit volume with "VOLUME"

The `VOLUME` directive documents that the specified directory _should_ be on a volume.

Sample from "[postgres](https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/blob/8a9fbcb40f13ccc7762f278b9df611cabe22d300/9.5/Dockerfile)" image:

```
FROM debian:jessie
RUN apt-get install -y postgresql-common postgresql-9.5
‚Ä¶
ENV PGDATA /var/lib/postgresql/data
VOLUME /var/lib/postgresql/data
‚Ä¶
```

Docker will <u>implicitly</u> add

```
-v /var/lib/postgresql/data
```

to the `docker run` command-line.

# Tip: drop privilege with "USER"

```
FROM python:3.6

# install app (as root)
COPY . /app

# create a user
RUN groupadd -r somebody
 && useradd -r -g somebody somebody

# let them write to /app/tmp
RUN mkdir /app/tmp
 && chown -R somebody:somebody /app/tmp

# run as that user (by default)
USER somebody
```

# Security

Let's talk about security.

---

# Outcomes

* I understand that choices I make impact the security of my systems
* I am aware of some security controls available to me
* I know where to go to learn more

---
# Choices

You make choices that impact the security of your systems:

* Which base image?
* Which linux distribution?
* Which packages to install?
* Which language runtime(s)?
* What source code you include?
* Which file permissions?
* Which user to run as?
* Which configuration is possible?
* Which volume mounts?
* Which seccomp profile?
* Which networks to connect it to?
* How frequently to update?

OMG!

# Base images

Would you use this image?

```
FROM docker123321/tomcat
```

---
# Base images (contd)
Lot's of people did. It was pulled 100k times!

> By pushing malicious images to a Docker Hub registry and pulling it from the victim‚Äôs system, hackers were able to mine 544.74 Monero, which is equal to $90000.

---
# Base Images: YOUR CHOICE

Base images are your choice. It's a choice about trust.

* Consider using [official repositories on DockerHub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/)
* Consider how frequently you update your base images 

---
# Linux distributions

What's a linux distribution?

```
# how many files come with the ubuntu image?
docker run ubuntu find / -xdev -type f | wc -l

# how many files come with the alpine image?
docker run alpine find / -xdev -type f | wc -l
```

Why is this relevant?

---
# Linux Distribution: YOUR CHOICE

You decide which linux distribution to use.

If you choose to use one, you place trust in the distribution's maintainers.

* Consider how distributions manage security updates
* Consider how compatibility, security and effort relate to your system

---
# User

What is a user? Why does it matter?

```
docker run alpine whoami
```

What user was used when `whoami` ran?

---
# User: YOUR CHOICE

It's your choice which user your program runs as.

Consider dropping to a non-privileged user:

```
echo 'FROM alpine' > Dockerfile
echo 'USER nobody' >> Dockerfile
docker build -t non-privileged .
docker run non-privileged whoami
```
---
# Writable Root file systems

When I start a container, can I change the contents of the file system?

```
docker run alpine rm -f /bin/sh
```
---
# Writable Root file system: YOUR CHOICE

It's your choice whether container file systems are writable.

Consider using a read-only root filesystem:

```
docker run --read-only alpine rm -f /bin/sh
rm: can't remove '/bin/sh': Read-only file system
```
---
# Secrets

What does this mean?

```
COPY continuous-integration.pem
```

What just happened?

---

# Secrets: YOUR CHOICE

It's your choice to add secrets to your docker image.

* Consider NEVER ADDING SECRETS to your docker image
* Consider using critical thinking before copy and paste from GitHub
* Consider using encrypted environment variables instead

---
# Getting help

Remember, you're not alone

* Talk to other people on your team
* Talk to your team's systems engineer
* Talk to your team's security advisor
* Ask on Slack

# What is Docker Compose?
<br>
<br>
--

From the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/">Docker Website</a>:

- Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

--

- With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application‚Äôs services.

--

- Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.


---
# Try it: docker-compose

Given YAML config file:

```
version: '2'

services:

  app:
    image: realestate/ciao

  proxy:
    image: realestate/ciao-proxy
    depends_on:
      - app
    environment:
      BACKEND: app
    ports:
      - 5678:80
```

You can start the containers with:

```
$ `cd exercises/composed/basic`
$ `docker-compose up`
```

---
# Try it: under the covers of compose

In a different window, generate some traffic:

```
$ `curl localhost:5678`
```
<br>
What containers are running?

```
$ `docker ps`
$ `cd exercises/composed/basic`
$ `docker-compose ps`
```
---
# How about networking?

### IP Address:

```
$ `docker inspect --format='{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}`
                           `{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' basic_app_1`

```

### MAC Address:

```
$ `docker inspect --format='{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}`
                           `{{.MacAddress}}{{end}}' basic_app_1`
```

---

# Take it all down:

<br>

- We may not want multiple docker containers from different docker-compose files running at the same time
- Halts images and cleans up resources

<br>

```
$ `docker-compose down`
```

---
# Try it: get compose to build your images

```
version: '2'

services:

  app:
    `build: ../../ciao`

  proxy:
    `build: ../../ciao-proxy`
    depends_on:
      - app
    environment:
      BACKEND: app
    ports:
      - 5678:80
```
--

```
$ `cd exercises/composed/autobuilt`
$ `docker-compose up`
```

---
# Try it: add a "client" container

```
version: '2'

services:
  app: ...
  proxy: ...

  client:
    build: ../../ubuntu-with-curl
    depends_on:
      - proxy
    command: sh -c "while true; do curl http://proxy; sleep 1; done"
```

```
$ `cd exercises/composed/with-curl`
$ `docker-compose up`
```

(Press Ctrl-C to tear everything down.)

---
# Try it: docker-compose run

Try "running" a "client" container:

```
$ `docker-compose run --rm client`
```

Or, go interactive:

```
$ `docker-compose run --rm client bash`
root@ebb0d01e63b0:/# `curl -i app`
root@ebb0d01e63b0:/# `curl -i proxy`
```

---
# Try it: sharing a volume

```
version: '2'

volumes:
  shared: {}

services:

  producer:
    image: busybox
    volumes:
      - shared:/out
    command: sh -c "while true; do date; sleep 1; done > /out/dates"

  consumer:
    image: ubuntu:14.04
    depends_on:
      - producer
    volumes:
      - shared:/data
    command: tail -f /data/dates
```

```
$ `cd exercises/composed/sharing`
$ `docker-compose up`
```

# Well done!

You made it.

---

# Try it: Python and Redis and .Net and PostgreSQL and Node.js

```
$ `cd exercises/example-voting-app`
$ `docker-compose up`
```

.center[
<img src="exercises/example-voting-app/architecture.png" width="75%"/>
]

---
# Try it: Python and Redis and .Net and PostgreSQL and Node.js

Once it's started running ...

* voting-app at <a href="http://localhost:5000" target="vote">http://localhost:5000</a>
* result-app at <a href="http://localhost:5001" target="results">http://localhost:5001</a>

When you're done, clean up:

```
$ `^C`
$ `docker-compose down`
```
